# Cocktail Page
For my second individual project, I used the public DB Cocktail API to build a front-end React web app with a cocktail details for up to 25 different drinks. The user can select the individual coccotails to see info, ingredients so on ..

There are there pages first, user find each cocktails on the first page or search their favourite drinks,
second page, the user can see individual drinks with more details .
on the third page is about us page.

Check out the deployed [Cocktail Page](https://645a3ddaf3cbe21728992819--incredible-medovik-5b29a1.netlify.app/)

## Stage One: Planning

Once I decided on what I wanted to do for my project, I started researching APIs to ensure that I could find one that would include the data I needed. I ended up choosing DB Cocktail API. While it has a limited number of Drinks compared to others, it allows you unlimited requests and includes the ingredients for each cocktails.
